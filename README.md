1. What has been correctly implemented:



2. Did you collaborate with anyone:

No, other than Ming.

3. Time spent on the assignment:

10 hours

example:

The 3 pages load correctly. The links work and the text aligns well. I had some trouble with correct nesting/indenting. I wasn't sure if it was the same as C++ because a few websites said different things for indentation for HTML. For example, on the resume, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to indent the 
more.

I did not collaborate with anyone for the assignment.

I spent 5 hours on the assignment. It was a little confusing to learn everything, but I definitely have a better understanding of HTML and CSS.
