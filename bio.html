      <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
      <p> My name is Melissa Baptista and I was born and raised in Somerville, MA. My parents are Brasilian immigrants and traveled to the United States of America in search for a better life. They soon met in a triple decker, and later had my younger brother, Jo√£o, and me. With my parents sacrificing so much for my education I learned to appreciate my opportunities at Tufts University. I never been exposed to media, computers, programming, etc. before, atleast to the capacity that Tufts offers. I soon saw that my creativity and yearning for problem solving could be grounded in the fields of study: Computer Science and Film and Media. I want to be able to create something that I am proud of.
